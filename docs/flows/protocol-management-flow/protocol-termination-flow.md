# Termination/Emergency halting

Follow the path in "Maintenance", but don't add new transaction family hashes.
Just remove the entry points.
In emergencies, you can just nuke the set of authorised reference scripts

Execute the following transaction families:

- Staking Validator Deregistering
  Deregister all staking validators
- Transaction family termination
  Remove all Authorised reference script utxos
